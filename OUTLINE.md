## 3. Technical Foundations: Graphs and LLM Semantics

### 3.1. Graph Databases: Relationship-Oriented Modeling

* **Primitives**:

  * Nodes (types: Dataset, API, Model, Column, Team, etc.)
  * Edges (relations: owns, derives, queries, observes)
  * Properties (version, timestamp, retention policy)
* **Engineering Benefits**:

  * Dynamic schema evolution.
  * Subgraph pattern matching and traversal.
  * Efficient ancestry tracing and lineage audits.

### 3.2. Large Language Models for Metadata Understanding

* **Key Functions**:

  * Generating embeddings.
  * Semantic search (contextual vs keyword).
  * QA, summarization, inference.
* **Embedding-Driven Metadata Indexing**:

  * Vector encodings of dataset descriptions, code, or documentation.
  * Similarity-driven joins across metadata sources.
* **GraphRAG: Structured Retrieval + LLM Reasoning**:

  * Systematic retrieval of graph neighborhood.
  * LLMs consume graph substructure as context for generation.

## 4. Graph-First Metadata Architectures

### 4.1. Graph Modeling in Data Engineering

* Entity modeling:

  * Lineage: Source ➜ Transform ➜ Output.
  * Access Control: Dataset ➜ Permission ➜ Role.
  * Observability: Metric ➜ Alert ➜ Owner.
* System blueprint diagrams of real-world metadata graphs.

### 4.2. Querying Graphs in Practice

  * Get node by ID or tag.
  * Traverse N levels.
  * Match patterns (e.g., dataset owned by team AND queried by pipeline).
* **Advanced Traversals**:

  * Multi-hop lineage tracing.
  * Fault impact prediction via reverse dependency graphs.
  * Centrality and influence score computation.

* Policy evaluation via subgraph resolution.

## 5. Embedding and Retrieval via LLMs

We begin this system with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applied specifically to metadata properties using embedding similarity. However, the broader engineering intent is to evolve towards more open and expressive patterns such as GraphRAG, which tightly integrates structured graph context with LLM-powered inference. This transition is being explored in the context of the YouTube8M dataset to validate how deeply personalized insights can be generated through semantic graph traversal and multi-hop context assembly. Ultimately, this system aims to demonstrate how AI can drive hyper-personalization at scale through graph-native metadata orchestration.

### 5.1. Vectorizing Metadata

* Embeddings for tables, metrics, documentation.
* Vector store (e.g., Cloudflare Vectorize) for similarity queries.
* Semantic join for schema-drift detection.

### 5.2. Orchestrating GraphRAG

* **Request Lifecycle**:

  1. User issues natural language query.
  2. LLM parses intent, entities.
  3. Graph query retrieves relevant subgraph.
  4. LLM generates grounded answer.
* **Infra Layers**:

  * Workers for orchestration.
  * KV for query state.
  * R2 for bulk import/export of graph nodes and edges.
  * D1 as the primary store, optimized for query performance.

### 5.3. LLM-Powered Inference and Auto-tagging

* Use LLMs to:

  * Classify data assets by usage.
  * Recommend access policies.
  * Identify shadow/legacy data.

### 6.1. Dataset Landscape

* Videos, labels, user actions as graph entities.
* Volume: >8 million videos, time-series segmentations.

### 6.2. Graph Design for YouTube8M

* Nodes: Video, Label, Segment, User, Channel.
* Edges: watches, tagged\_as, uploaded\_by.
* Engineering schema to represent multiscale video interactions.

### 6.3. ML Segmentation + Label Graph Inference

* ML pipeline to label temporal segments.
* Store label → segment → video relationships.
* Use graph to auto-suggest labels based on label co-occurrence across user graphs.

### 6.4. Personalization Engine

* Graph traversal from watched videos → semantic neighbors.
* Graph + embedding hybrid recommender.
* Query examples: “Find short unseen videos on biking like my past watches.”
