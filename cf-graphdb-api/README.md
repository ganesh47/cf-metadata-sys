# cf-graphdb-api

This package exposes the API for the Cloudflare based GraphDB. Documentation has been split into several files under [docs](docs/):

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Deployment Environments](docs/environments.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md)

The original readme content was reorganised for clarity. See the individual files above for full details.
