# Architecture Overview
This GraphDB implementation leverages Cloudflare's storage services strategically:

**Workers KV** serves as a high-performance cache layer for frequently accessed nodes and maintains adjacency lists for fast graph traversal. The eventually consistent nature of KV is acceptable here since we use D1 as the source of truth.

**D1** Database provides the relational foundation with ACID properties for storing nodes and edges with proper indexing for complex queries. This ensures data consistency and supports SQL-based graph queries.

**R2** Object Storage handles metadata exports and backups, storing large graph snapshots without egress fees. This is ideal for data archival and disaster recovery scenarios.

Key Features
**Node Management**: Create, read, update, and delete graph nodes with typed properties and metadata. Each node has a unique ID, type classification, and flexible property storage.

**Edge Relationships**: Define directed relationships between nodes with custom relationship types and properties. The system maintains bidirectional adjacency lists for efficient traversal.

**Graph Querying**: Execute complex queries filtering by node types, relationship types, and properties. The hybrid storage approach enables both fast lookups and complex analytical queries.

**Graph Traversal**: Perform depth-limited graph traversal starting from any node, with optional relationship type filtering. This supports use cases like dependency analysis and relationship mapping.

**Metadata Export/Import**: Full graph serialization to R2 for backup and migration purposes. This enables data portability and disaster recovery workflows.

The system combines the strengths of each Cloudflare storage service: KV for speed, D1 for consistency, and R2 for durability, creating a robust foundation for metadata management systems that require graph-like data relationships and fast global access patterns.
